# minitar
A minimal implementation of the tape archive (tar) format. This implementation supports tar-ing files, directories, and symlinks. It supports creating a new tar file, as well as opening an already existing tar file. Individual files can be added or removed from the loaded tar files, and then written back down to a disk or device.

## Usage as a library

```rust
minitar = "0.2.0"
```

See the cargo docs for usage and more information.
